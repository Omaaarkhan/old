        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Omar Khan, I am a 21 year old computer science student at the University of California, Davis. Previously, I was a Biological Sciences major but, I picked up learning JavaScript when the pandemic began, and instantlty fell in love with programming and started the process to switch my major to Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, I want to develop and engineer software to make a change in the world. I have always held the belief that humans must do what they can to benefit one another. Programming boosts the quality of life for people everyday, whether it is used on the morning compute, or everytime they look at their phone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am looking for Software Engineering internships for Summer 2022. I am a hardworker that would love to see mutual growth for me, the company I work at, and all those I meet in the process.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          I have a number of projects I have worked on, many of which were ideas that I conjured up while gaming or simply wanted to see in action. Software that I believe could be beneificial to me as well as others.
        </p>

        <p>
          1. I developed artificial intelligence that was trained through machine learning to be able to recognize human emotions. The AI would open the user's camera in the browser and display the emotion that the AI thinks was being presented. Additionally, the confidence level of the AI in how sure it was on the accuracy of the emotion was displayed. 
        </p>

        <p>
          2. I developed a bot to instantly add new sneaker releases to your cart and checkout with stored user payment and address information, the bot also supported recaptcha bypass to guarantee the maximum opportunity to successfully checkout out. The bot was developed with Python and the Selenium package was used to scrape website data. The pages for sneakers often went up early and so you could tell the bot what keywords to look for and by scraping data early, the bot could move forward with the checkout process.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Using GPT-3 and Python, I developed a Twitter bot that would generate parody tweets based on real tweets made by an account. The data was scraped using selenium agaain and GPT-3 would use this scraped data to post a new, machine-generated tweet after every X amount of time. The accounts would get taken down rather quickly because of reports or somehow a Twitter TOS violation would occur, I am currently trying to find a work around the TOS violations.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>Milestone Technologies at Facebook</h3>
        <p>
          Worked as a screening associate in the Summer of 2021, from July to September. While their I had to find ways to allow the capacity of the building to increase, while still being able to keep covid cases low. Additionally, I provided technical support with the color app, an app used to do online covid tests.
        </p>
        <h3>#Include at UC Davis</h3>
        <p>
          I currently work here as a full stack developer. I work on the web development team. As a web developer, I have to have constant communication with the design team to ensure that what has been implemented by me and my team is satisfactory. We develop websites for organizations and clients in and around Davis, California in order to boost their website traffic, and ultimately put them in a better scenario to help grow.
